SQL & Entity Framework Core Project

1. How to Run the Project

First, download the SQL-Project.

Open the file creating tables.sql and execute the following line:

CREATE DATABASE ItStepProject


After that, select the ItStepProject database and execute the rest of the script to create all tables.

Next, open inserting data.sql, make sure the correct database is selected, and execute the script to insert the data.

Then open task.sql, select the correct database, and execute one task at a time to verify that it works correctly.

Finally, download the Entity-Framework-Core-Project and connect the database to it.
If you don’t know how to do this, follow the instructions in How to Connect the Database to EF Core below.

2. How to Connect the Database to EF Core

To connect the database to EF Core, you need a connection string.

Run the following command in Package Manager Console:

Scaffold-DbContext "Server=(localdb)\mssqllocaldb;Database=CinemaBooking;Trusted_Connection=True;" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -OutputDir Models -ContextDir Data -DataAnnotations


Replace (localdb)\mssqllocaldb with your SQL Server name, which you can find in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
